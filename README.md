## Disclosures I need to get out there
By default, stats are aggregated for purely informational purposes. For example, displaying median height for a given age. Such publicly displayed information is *never* associated with your personal data, it's always reported entirely anonymously and not sold to a third party. You may opt out at any time.

## I-don't-invade-your-privacy policy
Your personal data is never supplied to third parties. Only the absolute minimum necessary information is stored and even then it is only used for the critical operation of the service, such as an email address to regain access to your account. Huge multibillion dollar companies mess this up so I don't even want to pretend I want the responsibility to protect your most vital personal information.

A third party is used to process payments for access to paid features. My service never has access to your payment information in any form. The payment process service let's me know you've paid and passes money to me. All I know is you gave me money. That's all I *want* to know. Do not try to tell me where you got the money. I will put my fingers in my ears and hum loudly.

You should practice safe password usage in the unlikely event the system security is ever compromised. You *really* should have a unique password for all your accounts. Yes, it's annoying and you probably don't do that. A reputable password manager helps and makes it almost painless.
